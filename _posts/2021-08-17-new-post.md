   Drinking alcohol is something very normal today. We are going to bar for a drink with friends, having a glass of vine after work to relax after a long day, going to parties with a lot of liquor!
   
   Even though most people know the horrible influence alcohol has. That it affects every organ in the drinker's body and can damage a developing fetus, intoxication can impair brain function and motor skills; heavy use can increase risk of certain cancers, stroke, and liver disease. People still drink it.
   
   But why?
   
   And the answer is really simple! Most people get drunk because it's fun. Some researchers used an app called Mappiness, created by the London School of Economics, to survey 31,000 users on their happiness at random points several times a day, on a scale of 1 to 100. They found that when users were drinking, their happiness increased by 10.79 points.
   
   What I decided to study is if the population who drinks more is more happy or not!
   For that particular reason I have the dataset called 'Alcohol consumption versus Happiness score'. I also have other social indexes here, but Iâ€™m not interested in them right now.
  
  **Loading and cleaning the data**
   ```javascript
import pandas as pd
import scipy.stats as st
import seaborn as sns
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from statsmodels.formula.api import ols
df = pd.read_csv('HappinessAlcoholConsumption.csv')
df.head()
```

   ```javascript
df.isnull().sum()
``` 
 ![pic2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Katerynapass/kateryna_pass.github.io/master/assets/img/pic__.png)
  
  ```javascript
df['Total_Alcohol_PerCapita'] = df['Beer_PerCapita']+df['Spirit_PerCapita']+df['Wine_PerCapita']
df.head()
```

  **Testing**
  
  I tested for a statistically significant relationship between Total Alcohol Per Capita and Happiness Score. I set my null and alternative hypotheses:
  
  
 **Ho** = There is no relationship between Total Alcohol Per Capita and Happiness Score.
 
 **Ha** = There is a relationship between Total Alcohol Per Capita and Happiness Score.
 
I calculated the linear regression line that models the relationship between Total Alcohol Per Capita and Happiness Score. For that i've fit OLS Model.

```javascript
model = ols('HappinessScore ~ Total_Alcohol_PerCapita', data = df).fit()
print(model.summary())
```

 Because my p-value is <0,05 I reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is a relationship between Total Alcohol Per Capita and Happiness Score.
 But such as R-squared is 0.30 or 30% that means that only 30% of the variability in Happiness Score is explained by difference in Total Alcohol Per Capita.
 
 70% of the variability in Happiness remains unexplained by the model. 
 
 I also Plotted the relationship between Total Alcohol Per Capita and Happiness Score to show how it would look on the graph.
 ```javascript
sns.lmplot(x='Total_Alcohol_PerCapita', y = 'HappinessScore', data = df, ci=None);
plt.title('Alcohol And Happiness Correlation');
```

 **Conclusion**
 
 It seems that alcohol can somehow influence your happiness, but we also have to remember that drinking often occurs when other pleasurable events are going on (like socializing with friends, sport games, parties) and we need to do much more research and analyzing to make better conclusion. 
For now all I want to say is take care and drink responsibly!
