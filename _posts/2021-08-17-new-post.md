Drinking alcohol is something very normal today.  We are going to bar for a drink with friends. Having a glass of vine after work to relax after a long day having parties with a lot of liquor! 
Even though most people know the horrible influence alcohol has.  That it affects every organ in the drinker's body and can damage a developing fetus. Intoxication can impair brain function and motor skills; heavy use can increase risk of certain cancers, stroke, and liver disease.
People still drink it. So why?
And the answer is really simple! Most people get drunk because it's fun.
Some researchers used an app called Mappiness, created by the London School of Economics, to survey 31,000 users on their happiness at random points several times a day, on a scale of 1 to 100. They found that when users were drinking, their happiness increased by 10.79 points, the Washington Post reports. Since drinking often occurs when other pleasurable events are going on (like socializing with friends), they controlled for those outside factors to find an increase of 4 pointsâ€”a significant amount, according to the researchers.
